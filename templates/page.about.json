During their stay at the San Pietro Hotel in Positano, they went to lunch and found themselves captivated by the hotel's colorful, handcrafted dinnerware. The next day they arranged to meet the artisans at a nearby factory in the town of Vietri sul Mare. As they watched the artisans paint, glaze, and fire each piece by hand, they were inspired to share the treasure they had discovered. The Gravelys returned home with an array of pieces with mixed patterns all related to nature. The collection would become known as Campagna, VIETRI's flagship dinnerware.<\/p>","button_label":"","button_link":"","button_style":"primary","align_text":"left","layout":"right","color_scheme":"none","divider":false}},"16612638180cc70ff5":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"1661263818e1a32fa3-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"WE FIND JOY AROUND THE TABLE"}},"1661263818e1a32fa3-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"enlarge_text":true,"text":"<p>Throughout the years, VIETRI's focus has been to celebrate the simple act of sharing a meal with family and friends.
