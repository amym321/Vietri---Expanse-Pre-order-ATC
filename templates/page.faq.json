It is important that baking and casserole pieces in our Old St. Nick collection be cured. Terra marrone collections such as Incanto, stoneware, and Italian stoneware collections do not require curing. To cure, fully submerge and soak piece in water for 15 minutes. This soaking prepares the dish, reduces cooking time, and prevents the food from sticking.<br\/><br\/>Hot casseroles and baking dishes should never be placed on cool, damp, or unprotected surfaces. VIETRI bakeware should never be taken directly from the refrigerator to the oven, and it should never be placed in the freezer unless otherwise noted. Please remove the bakeware from the oven by holding the body of the dish, supporting the base. The handles of these pieces are decorative and should not be used for support.
